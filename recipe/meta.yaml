  summary: Pandas and Polar DataFrames as interactive DataTables

  description: >-
    This packages changes how Pandas and Polars DataFrames are rendered in Jupyter Notebooks.
    With `itables` you can display your tables as interactive [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)
    that you can sort, paginate, scroll or filter.

    ITables is just about how tables are displayed. You can turn it on and off in just two lines,
    with no other impact on your data workflow.

    The `itables` package only depends on `numpy`, `pandas` and `IPython`
    which you must already have if you work with Pandas in Jupyter (add `polars`, `pyarrow` if you
    work with Polars DataFrames).
